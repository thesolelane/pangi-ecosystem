## Pangolin Biology (Educational)

### Real-World Facts

**Birth**:
- Live birth (NOT eggs)
- Babies called "pangopups"
- Typically single offspring
- Some Asiatic species: up to 3 pups

**Pangopup Development**:
- Born with soft, pale scales (pink/white)
- Scales harden within 2-3 days
- Scales darken as they mature
- Cling to mother's scales
- Ride on mother's back or tail base
- Stay with mother for first few months

**Scale Transformation**:
```
Birth → Soft, pale, flexible
Days 1-3 → Hardening begins
Week 1 → Scales firm up
Months 1-3 → Darkening and strengthening
Adulthood → Fully hardened, dark, protective armor
```
