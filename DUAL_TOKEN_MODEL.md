# PANGI Dual-Token Model: $PANGI + $CATH

## Executive Summary

**Two-token system** for sustainable ecosystem economics:
- **$PANGI**: Governance & value token (fixed supply)
- **$CATH**: Utility & rewards token (inflationary)

This model prevents value dilution while enabling sustainable rewards.

---

## Token Roles

### $PANGI - Governance & Value Token

**Purpose**: Store of value, governance, premium access

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Fixed supply: 1 Billion tokens
- ✅ Deflationary (buyback & burn)
- ✅ Governance voting power
- ✅ Premium features access
- ✅ Staking for $CATH rewards
- ❌ NOT used for daily transactions

**Use Cases**:
1. **Governance voting** (DAO proposals)
2. **Staking** (earn $CATH rewards)
3. **Premium access** (Special Editions, VIP features)
4. **Liquidity provision** (PANGI/SOL pool)
5. **Long-term holding** (value appreciation)

**Token Metrics**:
- Supply: 1,000,000,000 PANGI
- Initial Price: $0.001
- Target Price (1 year): $0.05-0.10
- Market Cap Goal: $50M-100M

---

### $CATH - Utility & Rewards Token

**Purpose**: Daily utility, rewards, in-ecosystem transactions

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Inflationary supply (controlled emission)
- ✅ Earned through staking/activities
- ✅ Used for all utility functions
- ✅ Burned through usage (deflationary pressure)
- ✅ Stable value target ($0.01-0.10)
- ❌ NOT for governance

**Use Cases**:
1. **NFT unlock** (stake $CATH to unlock adults)
2. **Breeding fees** (pay in $CATH)
3. **Marketplace fees** (buy/sell with $CATH)
4. **Guardian reporting** (earn $CATH rewards)
5. **Special Edition minting** (pay in $CATH)
6. **Merchandise** (buy with $CATH)
7. **Premium features** (pay in $CATH)

**Token Metrics**:
- Initial Supply: 100,000,000 CATH
- Emission Rate: 10% annually (decreasing)
- Burn Rate: 30-50% of usage
- Target Price: $0.01-0.10
- Stable value through burn mechanics

---

## Why Two Tokens?

### Problem with Single Token:

**If PANGI is used for everything**:
```
Year 1: PANGI = $0.01
- Unlock adult: 10,000 PANGI ($100)
- Breeding: 5,000 PANGI ($50)

Year 2: PANGI = $0.50 (50x growth)
- Unlock adult: 10,000 PANGI ($5,000) ❌ TOO EXPENSIVE
- Breeding: 5,000 PANGI ($2,500) ❌ UNUSABLE
```

**Result**: Utility becomes unaffordable as token appreciates

---

### Solution with Dual Tokens:

**$PANGI appreciates, $CATH stays stable**:
```
Year 1:
- PANGI = $0.01 (governance)
- CATH = $0.01 (utility)
- Unlock adult: 10,000 CATH ($100) ✅

Year 2:
- PANGI = $0.50 (50x growth) 🚀
- CATH = $0.02 (stable) ✅
- Unlock adult: 5,000 CATH ($100) ✅ STILL AFFORDABLE
```

**Result**: 
- PANGI holders get value appreciation
- Utility remains affordable
- Ecosystem stays functional

---

## Token Economics

### $PANGI Economics

**Supply Distribution** (1B total):
```
Community & Ecosystem: 400M (40%)
├─ Staking Rewards: 200M (20%) - Earn $CATH
├─ Airdrops to NFT Holders: 100M (10%)
├─ Community Treasury: 50M (5%)
└─ Liquidity Mining: 50M (5%)

Initial Liquidity: 150M (15%)
Team & Development: 200M (20%) - 2yr vest
Marketing & Partnerships: 100M (10%)
Reserve: 150M (15%)
```

**Deflationary Mechanics**:
1. **Buyback & Burn**: 10% of $CATH fees used to buy $PANGI
2. **Burn Events**: Quarterly burns from treasury
3. **Locked Staking**: Reduces circulating supply
4. **LP Locking**: Permanent liquidity removal

**Value Accrual**:
- $CATH fees → Buy $PANGI → Burn
- NFT royalties → Buy $PANGI → Treasury
- Merchandise sales → Buy $PANGI → Burn
- Partnership revenue → Buy $PANGI → Distribute to stakers

---

### $CATH Economics

**Initial Supply** (100M):
```
Staking Rewards Pool: 50M (50%)
├─ NFT Staking: 30M
├─ PANGI Staking: 15M
└─ Liquidity Mining: 5M

Ecosystem Fund: 20M (20%)
├─ Guardian Rewards: 10M
├─ Community Incentives: 5M
└─ Partnerships: 5M

Initial Liquidity: 15M (15%)
Team & Development: 10M (10%) - 1yr vest
Reserve: 5M (5%)
```

**Emission Schedule**:
```
Year 1: 10M CATH (10% inflation)
Year 2: 9M CATH (8.2% inflation)
Year 3: 8M CATH (6.7% inflation)
Year 4: 7M CATH (5.4% inflation)
Year 5+: 5M CATH annually (decreasing %)
```

**Burn Mechanics**:
```
All $CATH usage burns a portion:

NFT Unlock: 10,000 CATH
├─ 5,000 CATH burned (50%)
├─ 3,000 CATH to staking rewards (30%)
└─ 2,000 CATH to treasury (20%)

Breeding Fee: 5,000 CATH
├─ 2,500 CATH burned (50%)
├─ 1,500 CATH to staking rewards (30%)
└─ 1,000 CATH to treasury (20%)

Marketplace Fee: 2% in CATH
├─ 1% burned
├─ 0.6% to staking rewards
└─ 0.4% to treasury
```

**Net Effect**:
- Emission: +10M CATH/year
- Burn: -5M to -15M CATH/year (depends on usage)
- Net: Deflationary if high usage, slight inflation if low usage

```

---

## Burn Mechanisms

### $PANGI Burns

**Quarterly Buyback & Burn**:
```
Source: 10% of all $CATH fees
Process:
1. Collect CATH fees
2. Swap CATH → SOL → PANGI
3. Burn PANGI permanently
4. Announce burn amount

Example:
- Q1 Fees: 1M CATH
- Buyback: 100K CATH → 10K PANGI
- Burn: 10K PANGI (0.001% of supply)
```

**Annual Burn Events**:
```
Source: Treasury reserves
Amount: 1-5% of treasury
Purpose: Reduce supply, increase scarcity
```

---

### $CATH Burns

**Usage Burns** (Automatic):
```
Every CATH transaction burns a portion:

NFT Unlock: 50% burned
Breeding: 50% burned
Special Editions: 50% burned
Marketplace: 50% of fee burned
Merchandise: 30% burned
```

**Burn Rate Projections**:
```
Low Activity:
- 1,000 unlocks/month = 5M CATH burned/year
- Net: +5M CATH (slight inflation)

Medium Activity:
- 5,000 unlocks/month = 25M CATH burned/year
- Net: -15M CATH (deflationary)

High Activity:
- 10,000 unlocks/month = 50M CATH burned/year
- Net: -40M CATH (highly deflationary)
```

---

## Governance

### $PANGI Governance

**Voting Power**: 1 PANGI = 1 vote

**Proposal Types**:
1. **Protocol changes** (tax rates, fees)
2. **Treasury spending** (>$10,000)
3. **Partnership approvals**
4. **Tokenomics adjustments**
5. **Feature prioritization**

**Voting Process**:
```
1. Proposal submitted (requires 100K PANGI)
2. Discussion period (7 days)
3. Voting period (7 days)
4. Execution (if >51% approval)
```

**Staked PANGI**: Voting power multiplied by lock duration
- 30 days: 1x voting power
- 90 days: 1.5x voting power
- 180 days: 2x voting power
- 365 days: 3x voting power

---

### $CATH Governance

**No Governance Rights**
- CATH is utility only
- Cannot vote on proposals
- Cannot influence protocol

**Why?**
- Prevents governance attacks
- Keeps utility token focused
- Aligns incentives with PANGI holders

Total: ~$150,000/year in CATH
```

**Merchandise**:
```
T-shirts, plushies, etc.
