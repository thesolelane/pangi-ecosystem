## Price Stability Mechanisms

### Target Price Range: $0.01 - $0.10

#### If CATH Price > $0.10 (Too Expensive)

**Actions**:
1. **Increase emission rate** by 10-20%
2. **Reduce burn rate** (40% instead of 50%)
3. **Lower unlock costs** (8,000 CATH instead of 10,000)
4. **Increase staking rewards** (12 CATH/day instead of 10)

**Goal**: Increase supply, reduce demand, lower price

---

#### If CATH Price < $0.01 (Too Cheap)

**Actions**:
1. **Decrease emission rate** by 10-20%
2. **Increase burn rate** (60% instead of 50%)
3. **Raise unlock costs** (12,000 CATH instead of 10,000)
4. **Decrease staking rewards** (8 CATH/day instead of 10)
5. **Treasury buyback** (buy CATH with SOL, burn)

**Goal**: Decrease supply, increase demand, raise price

---

### Dynamic Pricing Formula

**Unlock Cost Adjustment**:
```
Base Cost: 10,000 CATH
Target Price: $0.05 USD
Current Price: Variable

Adjusted Cost = Base Cost × (Target Price / Current Price)

Examples:
- If CATH = $0.10: Cost = 10,000 × (0.05/0.10) = 5,000 CATH
- If CATH = $0.05: Cost = 10,000 × (0.05/0.05) = 10,000 CATH
- If CATH = $0.01: Cost = 10,000 × (0.05/0.01) = 50,000 CATH

Result: Unlock always costs ~$500 USD regardless of CATH price
```

**Staking Reward Adjustment**:
```
Base Reward: 10 CATH/day
Target Price: $0.05 USD
Current Price: Variable

Adjusted Reward = Base Reward × (Current Price / Target Price)

Examples:
- If CATH = $0.10: Reward = 10 × (0.10/0.05) = 20 CATH/day
- If CATH = $0.05: Reward = 10 × (0.05/0.05) = 10 CATH/day
- If CATH = $0.01: Reward = 10 × (0.01/0.05) = 2 CATH/day

Result: Staking always earns ~$0.50/day regardless of CATH price
```

## Supply Dynamics

### Circulating Supply Projection

#### Year 1
```
Starting Supply: 100,000,000 CATH
Emission: +10,000,000 CATH
Burn (medium activity): -45,600,000 CATH
Ending Supply: 64,400,000 CATH (35.6% deflation)
```

#### Year 2
```
Starting Supply: 64,400,000 CATH
Emission: +9,000,000 CATH
Burn (medium activity): -41,000,000 CATH
Ending Supply: 32,400,000 CATH (49.7% deflation)
```

#### Year 3
```
Starting Supply: 32,400,000 CATH
Emission: +8,000,000 CATH
Burn (medium activity): -36,500,000 CATH
Ending Supply: 3,900,000 CATH (87.9% deflation)
```

**Note**: If supply gets too low, emission rate increases to maintain liquidity

---

### Supply Floor

**Minimum Circulating Supply**: 10,000,000 CATH

**If supply drops below 10M**:
- Emission rate doubles
- Burn rate reduces to 30%
- Unlock costs halve
- Staking rewards double

**Goal**: Maintain sufficient liquidity for utility

---

## Market Cap Projections

### At $0.01 per CATH

```
Year 1: 64.4M supply × $0.01 = $644,000 market cap
Year 2: 32.4M supply × $0.01 = $324,000 market cap
Year 3: 3.9M supply × $0.01 = $39,000 market cap
```

### At $0.05 per CATH

```
Year 1: 64.4M supply × $0.05 = $3.22M market cap
Year 2: 32.4M supply × $0.05 = $1.62M market cap
Year 3: 3.9M supply × $0.05 = $195,000 market cap
```

### At $0.10 per CATH

```
Year 1: 64.4M supply × $0.10 = $6.44M market cap
Year 2: 32.4M supply × $0.10 = $3.24M market cap
Year 3: 3.9M supply × $0.10 = $390,000 market cap
```

**Target**: Maintain $1M-10M market cap for liquidity

---

## Value Accrual

### How $CATH Gains Value

**Demand Drivers**:
1. **NFT unlocks**: 1,500 potential unlocks × 10,000 CATH = 15M CATH demand
2. **Breeding**: Unlimited potential
3. **Marketplace**: All secondary sales
4. **Merchandise**: Ongoing demand
5. **Staking**: Reduces circulating supply

**Supply Reducers**:
1. **Burns**: 50% of all usage
2. **Staking**: Locks tokens
3. **LP provision**: Locks tokens
4. **Decreasing emission**: 10% → 5% annually

**Result**: High demand + Decreasing supply = Price appreciation

---

### How $PANGI Benefits from $CATH

**Value Flow**:
```
CATH fees collected
↓
20% to treasury (in CATH)
↓
Treasury swaps CATH → SOL → PANGI
↓
PANGI burned quarterly
↓
PANGI supply decreases
↓
PANGI price increases
```

**Example**:
```
Q1 CATH Fees: 10,000,000 CATH
Treasury Share: 2,000,000 CATH (20%)
Swap to PANGI: 2M CATH → 20K PANGI
Burn: 20,000 PANGI (0.002% of supply)

Annual: 80,000 PANGI burned (0.008% of supply)
Over 5 years: 400,000 PANGI burned (0.04% of supply)
```
